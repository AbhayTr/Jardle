# Jardle

## About the Project

Jardle is a word-guessing game which is majorly inspired by the concept of © New York Time’s Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). The major features of Jardle that makes Jardle better than Wordle are:
- Rich database of 10,000 variable length English Words available offline so that the player can play the game anywhere, anytime!
- Variable word sizes making the game more interesting and challenging.
- Immediate change of word which is chosen randomly after the guessing of the current word or exhausting all the attempts so that the player never gets bored while playing the game.
- Offline database of more than 400,000+ English words available offline to check whether the word entered by the player is a correct English word or not, without having to connect to some online database to do the same, hence making the game completely offline and faster.
- Multiple Levels to vary word length to match various levels of guessing skills of various kinds of players so that the game is interesting for all kinds of players.
- Audio Indicators which clearly indicate the state of each letter present in the entered word, letter by letter, hence making it easy to play for people with impaired eyesight also.
